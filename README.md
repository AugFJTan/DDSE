# Doki Doki Starry-Eyed - A DDLC Fan Mod!
Finally! Sayori and MC are a couple! And with the school festival finally over, MC and the girls meet up for another Literature Club meeting. Everything seems perfect. But as old problems fade away, new ones emerge. With doubts looming over Sayori's head, will our starry-eyed lovers become star-crossed lovers? And where will the morals of the other girls lie when the first crack in their relationship becomes visible?
